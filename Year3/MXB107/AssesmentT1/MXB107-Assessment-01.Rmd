\
**For this Assessment we will use the following dataset:**

**The dataset**   `episodes` **included in the MXB107 package for R contains records for 704 episodes of the _Star Trek_ aired between 1966 and 2005.  (Type** `?episodes` **for a detailed description of the data.)**

## Part 1: Summarising Data

### Question 1

a.    Name three principles for good practice when creating graphical summaries of data. 

:::{.box}
**Type your answer here:**\
1. Always have a title for your graphical summary. The titles should accurately describe the variables and the relationship shown in the summry.
  If one of the axes is time or the data is for a specific period, that should be in the title.
2. Clearly label the axes and include units.
3. When comparing two data sets, the axes for each summary should be match.

:::
b.    Identify three elements of the following graphical summary of data that should be corrected. 
```{r,warning = FALSE, echo=FALSE}
plot1 <- ggplot(episodes %>% filter(Series == "TOS"),aes(x = IMDB.Ranking))+
  geom_histogram(bins = 13)+xlab("")

plot2 <- ggplot(episodes %>% filter(Series == "TNG"),aes(x = IMDB.Ranking))+
   geom_histogram(bins = 13)+xlab("")

 grid.arrange(plot1, plot2, ncol=2)

```

:::{.box}
**Type your answer here:**\

1. Cut the cars    
2. Add title and buttom
3. draw a line?
:::

c.    Create a set of boxplots showing the IMDB rankings for each series of _Star Trek_.  Discuss the results. 

**Show your code here:**

```{r}
##  The library MXB107 should be already loaded, if not type:

##  library(MXB107)

##  If after loading the library if the dataset episodes not available, type:

data(episodes)
boxplot(IMDB.Ranking~Series, data = episodes, main = "Compare Rating for all Star Trek series",
        xlab = "Series name", ylab = "Rating", col = "red", border = "brown")
```

:::{.box}
**Type your answer here:**
Box plot shows six things that the reader can easily pick up, those are The minimum(which is the bottom of the line), Q1 and Q3(The size of the box from the bottom to the top), median(the middle line inside the box), maximum (at the top of the line), and the outlines(circles that is not on the line).
:::

d.    Create a pair of histograms comparing the IMDB rankings for episodes of _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ that pass the Bechdel-Wallace Test versus those that failed. Discuss the results. 

**Show your code here:**

```{r}
##  The library MXB107 should be already loaded, if not type:
